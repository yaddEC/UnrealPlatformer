## FEATURES
- Blueprint : the Blueprint Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based 
	on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor.
	As with many common scripting languages, it is used to define object-oriented (OO) classes or objects in the engine.
- Level Design : 
	It also allows us to work on our level design skills.
	Our current game world [PlatFormer/Content/StarterContent/Maps/PlatScene.umap]
	was made only with cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres.
